# Security Monitoring Dataset

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Let me walk you through our dataset.

## What's Inside?
We've combined multiple Kaggle datasets to create something really comprehensive:

1. **COCO 2017 Security Dataset**
   - Around 330K labeled images
   - Carefully picked security-relevant objects
   - Professional annotations for accuracy

2. **Weapon Detection Dataset**
   - Over 3000 weapon images
   - Different types of weapons
   - Various real-world environments

3. **Suspicious Activity Recognition**
   - Real human behavior patterns
   - Natural motion sequences
   - Carefully labeled activities

## How We Processed It
We didn't just dump everything together! Here's what we did:
1. Hand-picked the most relevant classes
2. Combined data thoughtfully
3. Added our own annotations
4. Made sure classes were balanced

## Quick Stats
- Total Images: 50,000
- Classes: 8 (people, weapons, bags, etc.)
- Where: 60% indoor, 40% outdoor
- When: 70% daytime, 30% nighttime

## Ethics Matter!
We took extra care to:
- Keep annotations privacy-friendly
- Watch out for biases
- Set clear usage guidelines
- Keep everything up-to-date
