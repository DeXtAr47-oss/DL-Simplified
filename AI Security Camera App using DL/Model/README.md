# üé• Security Camera AI Detection System

## üìù Abstract

Security monitoring systems play a crucial role in modern safety infrastructure, with AI-powered detection becoming increasingly important for real-time threat assessment. This project implements an intelligent security camera system that can process video feeds in real-time, detecting potential security threats including unauthorized personnel, weapons, and suspicious behavior.

The system utilizes advanced deep learning techniques including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Single Shot Detectors (SSD) to achieve high-accuracy object detection and classification, while maintaining low latency for real-time applications.

## üåê Context

Traditional security camera systems rely heavily on human operators, leading to potential oversight due to fatigue or limited attention span. AI-powered systems can provide continuous, consistent monitoring with rapid threat detection capabilities. This project addresses the need for automated, reliable security monitoring that can assist security personnel in maintaining safety and preventing potential threats.
